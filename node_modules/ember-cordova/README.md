#ember-cordova (beta)

ember-cordova simplifies building Cordova applications with Ember.js.

It includes a CLI for builds, hooks, device event bindings, and handles splash screens, icons and a growing number of supported Ember/Cordova plugin bindings.

It is a beta fork of ember-cli-cordova, but should have similar
stability. It includes new features discussed below.

##Platforms & Requirements

ember-cordova has been tested and works on Ember 1.13 &
greater, including 2+.

When push comes to shove we are likely to only support Ember 2.4 or
greater.

##Getting Started

If you are migrating from ember-cli-cordova, read the [migration
guide](docs/migration-from-ember-cli.md).


```
  ember install ember-cordova
```

You can optionally pass name & cordovaid params, which will set the id &
display name of your Cordova application. If none exist, your Ember Apps
name will be used.

If you already have a Cordova project here it will not be overwritten.

Make sure your config.locationType is set to 'hash'.

As a final step, add your desired platforms, e.g.:

```
ember cdv platform add ios
ember cdv platform add android
ember cdv platform add browser #experimental
```

Cordova working relies on the cordova.js script being injected. By default, this happens using ember cdv commands. Your vanilla ember build && ember s commands will not inject cordova.js by design.

### A note on browser platform

Some cordova/phonegap plugins have browser fallbacks. For example [phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner) will ask you to manually type the barcode value. Using the browser platform, you'll be able to develop your cordova app as it was a regular ember app.

##Features and Documentation
* [CLI](docs/cli.md)
* [Cordova Service & Event Bindings](docs/services/cordova.md)
* Device:
*  *  [Platform Service](docs/services/platform.md)
*  *  [Splash Screen Management](docs/services/splashscreen.md)
*  *  [Keyboard](docs/keyboard.md)

##Upcoming Extensions

We are working on four major items right now:

1. Improving test coverage;
2. Livereload improvements;
3. Bindings to Cordova Plugins [see plugins](docs/plugins.md); and
4. Either having ember install ember-cordova-plugin-foo install both the
ember addon & cordova plugin, or achieving the same through ember
cdv:install foo.
